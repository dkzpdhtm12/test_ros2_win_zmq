# Summary

This package is designed to control the robot in the ROS environment and to check the status of the robot using ZMQ in Windows C#.

The simulation and actual robot environment is ROS2-Foxy and I confirmed that the code works as desired in this environment.

In ROS2-Humble, I confirmed that you are using ZMQ in Windows C# to publishe topic and subscribe to topic in ROS.

So if you reprogramming this code, you will be able to control the robot in the ROS2-Humble environment using ZMQ in Windows C#.
